# Wardrobe - Style, your way!

Never let your fashion look stale, Wardrobe generates random and exciting combinations from the clothes you already own!

### Features
  - Click pictures of shirts and pants and store them in Wardrobe's database
- Generate random combos upon opening the app, or by pressing the refresh button in-app
- Favorite a certain combo and easily view favorites at any time
- Get notified every morning that the day's combo is ready

  
### Future Ideas
  - Understand the user's gender preferences and switch to using more appropriate words like top instead of shirt, and bottoms instead of pants
- Move the Add button to the toolbar once the user has added a certain amount of clothes to give a richer experience
- Adapt to the user by asking him/her what time they'd like to receive a notification
- Implement TensorFlow's machine learning capabilities to check whether the clicked image is clothes or not
